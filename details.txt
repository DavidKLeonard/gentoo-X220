# gentoo

All the files used to configure my gentoo installation on my X220

.xinitrc goes in /home/dkl/

make.conf goes in /etc/portage/

dwm, st, dmenu, etc. all go in /root/.config/

dwm has been configured to use the media controls on the X220

st is the build from Luke Smith

slstatus is the build from Mental Outlaw

I have taken two scripts from Mental Outlaw to install X11. These are dependencies.txt and install_dependencies.sh
